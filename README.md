# Data Analytics For Smart Agriculture
# A Study on Laying Hen

In this study, we will expose the data analysis done starting from data gathered from an eggs farm near Mantova to see if itâ€™s possible to improve both animal welfare and farmer revenue.
Upon talking with the farmer we focus our attention on 3 main topics which involve:
* Understanding the mortality between different cycles and organic with non-organic.
* Improve the welfare of the chickens.
* Quantify the losses in cycle C
